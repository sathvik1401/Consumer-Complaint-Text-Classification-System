# Consumer Complaint Text Classification System

An end-to-end machine learning project that automatically classifies consumer financial complaints into 4 categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning techniques.

üìã Project Overview

This project builds an intelligent classification system that processes consumer complaint narratives and categorizes them into one of four complaint types:

- Category 0: Credit reporting, repair, or other personal consumer reports
- Category 1: Debt collection
- Category 2: Consumer Loan (including student loans, vehicle loans, personal loans)
- Category 3: Mortgage

The system achieves **88.63% classification accuracy** on unseen data, making it suitable for real-world deployment in financial institutions and regulatory bodies.

üéØ Problem Statement

With over 11 million consumer complaints in the database, manual classification is:
- Time-consuming and expensive
- Prone to human error and inconsistency
- Difficult to scale as complaint volume grows

This automated system provides instant, accurate classification to help route complaints to appropriate departments and identify emerging consumer protection issues.
